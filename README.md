Autonomous decentralized validation of domain-specific reputation is a core decentalized
infrastructure necessity.

The main design goals for measuring domain-specific reputation in autonomous decentralized and
anonymous systems are to:

1) evaluate domain specific reputation across a wide variety of expertises
2) insure security, including resistance to Sybil attacks, tyranny of the majority, and 51% attacks
3) provide a minimal, robust core architecture which supports modular constructions for a wide
range of use cases

The key features are:
1) a positive feedback loop which promotes productive cooperation between public and expert
users
2) maximal freedom for experts in the creation of reputation verification protocols
3) complete autonomy—the economic structure is closed to off-domain influence; all power and
fees are shared entirely by expert users, weighted by reputation
4) meritocracy—the platform supports anonymity, rewarding ability and productive contributions
over personal identity

The creation of a transparent, fair, and predictable system that facilitates certainty of outcomes,
security, and efficiency benefits society with the advancement of justice and prevention of
corruption on a global scale.
